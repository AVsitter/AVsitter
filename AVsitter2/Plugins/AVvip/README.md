## AVpos Notes

**BUTTON VIP\*|90210**

This displays the custom button 'VIP', using channel 90210 for communications, do not change this number. You can change the button label 'VIP' to something else, but do not remove the * asterisk behind the name. Remember, do not use 'TOMENU' for this restricted menu as it would override.

**MENU VIP** 

This is where you put your access restricted entries but remember to change 'VIP' to the same label as used for the button.
