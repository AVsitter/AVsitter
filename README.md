# [AVsitter](https://avsitter.github.io)™

Repository for [AVsitter](https://avsitter.github.io)&trade; - a furniture pose system for [Second Life](https://www.secondlife.com)&reg; and [OpenSim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSimulator), written in [LSL](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Portal).

## Getting the AVsitter2 scripts in Second Life/Opensim

1. You can manually import the AVsitter scripts into Second Life / Opensim by following our [AVsitter2 Import Guide](AVsitter2/IMPORT_GUIDE.md).

    *or*

2. If you would prefer a pre-packaged version of the latest release, and to receive packaged [in-world updates](https://avsitter.github.io/updates.html) of future releases, then visit the [SL Marketplace](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/stores/79645). Proceeds from marketplace sales are shared with open-source contributors and will help support continued development of AVsitter.

## Editing the AVsitter2 code

You can edit any scripts, as long as you stay in compliance with the license (see below); however, in order to benefit from the extra memory that the SL Marketplace version provides, you're advised to optimize the scripts following the same method used for packaging the releases. There's a guide on how to do it here: [Release Building Guide](AVsitter2/BUILD_GUIDE.md)

## License

For increased script memory, scripts can be run through [LSL-PyOptimizer online](http://lsl.blacktulip-virtual.com/lsl-pyoptimizer/online.php). If you do this, please keep the [license notification](/LICENSE_script_header) intact in the header of any scripts you distribute.
